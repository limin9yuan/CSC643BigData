## Introduction
This project is developed in Python. It is built on top of [WebApp2][webapp2] framework with the standard [Python Client API Libraries][goog_py_cli_api] to access to Google's backend public datasets.

The application developed in this project allows web clients to process the following form-driven queries:
+ a) How many stories are there?
+ b) Which story has received the lowest score?
+ c) On average which URL produced the best story in 2010?
+ d) List how many stories where posted by each author on nytimes.com and wired.com.
